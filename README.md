# Rubik's Cube Move Practice App

I was learning the moves of a Rubik's cube a few years ago and created this simple utility to help me get used to the general move names.

Every 10 seconds, a new move name is displayed on screen, and to practice it would involve doing the move displayed on screen.

## Move Types

Directions:

- U (Up)
- D (Down)
- L (Left)
- R (Right)
- F (Forwards)
- B (Backwards)

Modifiers:

- (nothing)
- ' (Reverse)
- 2 (Two times)
